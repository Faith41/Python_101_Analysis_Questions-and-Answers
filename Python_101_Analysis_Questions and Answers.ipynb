    "## 1. What is garbage collection in the context of Python, and why is it important? Can you explain how memory management is handled in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "Garbage collection (GC) is a form of automatic memory management in Python. It is important because it identifies and frees up memory that is no longer in use, preventing memory leaks and ensuring efficient utilization of memory resources. \n",
    "\n",
    "Memory management in Python is handled using a combination of reference counting and a cyclic garbage collector:\n",
    "- **Reference Counting:** Every object maintains a count of references to it. When this count drops to zero, the memory occupied by the object is deallocated.\n",
    "- **Cyclic Garbage Collector:** This component handles cyclic references, cleaning up objects that reference each other.\n",

    "## 2. What are the key differences between NumPy arrays and Python lists? Can you explain the advantages of using NumPy arrays in numerical computations?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "- **Data Type:** NumPy arrays are homogeneous (same type), while Python lists can hold mixed types.\n",
    "- **Performance:** NumPy arrays are faster and more memory-efficient for numerical computations due to their contiguous memory storage.\n",
    "- **Functionality:** NumPy provides many built-in mathematical functions that can be applied directly to arrays, while Python lists do not have such capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages of Using NumPy Arrays:**\n",
    "- **Memory Efficiency:** NumPy arrays use less memory.\n",
    "- **Speed:** Operations are executed in compiled C code, faster than Python loops.\n",
    "- **Vectorization:** Supports element-wise operations, enhancing performance.\n",

    "## 3. How does list comprehension work in Python? Can you provide an example of using it to generate a list of squared values or filter a list based on a condition?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "List comprehension provides a concise way to create lists. It consists of an expression followed by a `for` clause and can include an optional `if` clause.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Generate a List of Squared Values\n",
    "```python\n",
    "squared_values = [x**2 for x in range(10)]\n",
    "print(squared_values)  # Output: [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]\n",
    "Example: Filter a List Based on a Condition\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n",
    "even_numbers = [x for x in numbers if x % 2 == 0]\n",
    "print(even_numbers)  # Output: [2, 4, 6]"

    "4. Can you explain the concepts of shallow and deep copying in Python, including when each is appropriate, and how deep copying is implemented?\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "Shallow Copy: Creates a new object but copies references to nested objects. Use it when you want a copy without duplicating nested objects.\n",
    "python\n",
    "original = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]\n",
    "shallow_copied = copy.copy(original)\n",
    "shallow_copied[0][0] = 'A'  # Affects the original\n",
    "print(original)  # Output: [['A', 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]\n",
    "Deep Copy: Creates a new object and recursively copies all nested objects. Use it when you want a complete, independent copy.\n",
    "python\n",
    "deep_copied = copy.deepcopy(original)\n",
    "deep_copied[0][0] = 'B'  # Does not affect the original\n",
    "print(original)  # Output: [['A', 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]"

    "5. Explain with examples the difference between lists and tuples.\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "Mutability:\n",
    "Lists: Mutable, can be changed after creation.\n",
    "Tuples: Immutable, cannot be altered after creation.\n",
    "Example of a List\n",

    "my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "my_list.append(4)  # List is mutable\n",

    "Example of a Tuple\n",

    "my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)\n",
    "# my_tuple.append(4)  # This would raise an AttributeError\n",
